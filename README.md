Task 4: Three resistances R1, R2, R3 are set. Calculate the value of the resistance R0 using the formula: 1 / R0 = 1 / R1 + 1 / R2 + 1 / R3. Control example: R1=2, R2=4, R3=8 RO = 1.142857

Task 5: For a given circumference, find the area of the circle using the formula S = piR2, calculate the radius from the circumference formula: L = 2pi R Note pi = 3.14

Task 6: Calculate the distance traveled in rectilinear equidistant motion using the formula 5 = vt + (at2) / 2, where ัต is speed, t is time, and acceleration.

Task 7: The user enters the distance to the airport and the time it takes to get there from the keyboard. Calculate the speed at which he needs to go.

Task 8: The user enters the start and end time of a telephone conversation (hours, minutes and seconds) from the keyboard. Calculate the cost of a conversation if the cost of a minute is 30 kopecks.

Task 9: The user enters the distance, fuel consumption per 100 km and the cost of three types of fuel from the keyboard. Display a comparison table with the cost of a trip on different types of fuel.
